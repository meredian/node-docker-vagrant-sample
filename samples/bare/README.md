Bare Node.js server
===================

Server without any dependencies, just some modules to install. Chech `localhost:3000` to see if it is working

To run server after installing vagrant and docker:

 - `vagrant up` to launch environment
 - `vagrant docker-logs` to see agregated logs from docker containers
